# NOTICE:
For RPI-2241 dataset, the protein and RNAs in "RPI2241_all.txt" are converted to all uppercase. 
If the same name (PDB name + chain) happens in both protein and RNA columns, then 
one's chain should be small case, the other should be uppercase. More details please refer to PDB. <br>

 Our program is case-insensitive to the case of protein or RNA names, hence, our program will convert the 
 protein and RNA name into upper case when reading the RNA and protein fasta file separately. 
 For example, 2ZKR-C (the name in our pair file  are all the uppercase, we will know in PDB) will actually use the sequence 2ZKR-c  
 in "RPI2241_protein.fa" (note C and c here).
